use <RIOTBASE> as the path to the
root of RIOT. You should replace that with your own path.

1. Go to the application directory:
   $ cd <RIOTBASE>/tests/shell

2. Build and flash the application for your board:

   $ BOARD=thingy91 make all flash

3. Now we have to start the JLink debugger manually (this is the part
that is not currently working for some reason). For this you need the
JLink software, which we installed yesterday (don't forget to replace
<RIOTBASE> with your path):

   $ JLinkExe -nogui 1 -exitonerror 1 -device "NRF9160_XXAA" -speed
"2000" -if "SWD" -jtagconf -1,-1 -commandfile
<RIOTBASE>/dist/tools/jlink/term.seg

4. On ANOTHER terminal, execute pyterm on the correct port:

   $ <RIOTBASE>/dist/tools/pyterm/pyterm -ts 19021

You should see RIOT shell's prompt ('>'), if not try pressing Enter.
